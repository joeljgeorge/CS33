1A.
x is stored in register %rdi, but during runtime it gets stored in register %r8 in line 7 of the assembly code.
n is stored in register %esi, and is then moved to  %ecx in line 1.
result is stored in register %rax.
mask is stored in register %rdx.

B.
Result has an initial value of 0. Mask has an initial value of 1. 

C.
The test condition for mask is (mask != 0), which is represented by lines 12 and 13 in the assembly code.

D.
Mask gets updated by being left shifted by the value represented by the lower 8 bits of n; this is represented by line 10 in the assembly code.

E.
Result gets updated by (result |= (x & mask)), which is represented by line 9 in the assembly code.

F.
//done in long.c
